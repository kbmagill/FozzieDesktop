# Contributing to FozzieDesktop

We love your input! We want to make contributing to FozzieDesktop as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FozzieDesktop.git
cd FozzieDesktop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run electron-dev
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (we use ESLint/Prettier)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Include integration tests for complex features

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/raymondclowe/FozzieDesktop/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/raymondclowe/FozzieDesktop/issues/new); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Please:

- Check if the feature already exists or is planned
- Describe the feature in detail
- Explain why it would be useful
- Consider implementation complexity
